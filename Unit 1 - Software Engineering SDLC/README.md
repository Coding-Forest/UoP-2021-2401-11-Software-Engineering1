### Key term & concepts

#### People!
  - Fritz Kahn
  - Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898-1972) is one of the world‚Äôs most famous graphic artists, known for his socalled impossible structures
  - Reuben Lucius Goldberg (Rube Goldberg) (1883-1970) was a Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist, sculptor, and author.

1.1
  - software domain vs problem domain (application domain)
  - ‚Äúcoarse graining‚Äù: meaning that our abstractions for solution development are unavoidably just approximations (because we are not the experts of the problem domain).
  - The second law of thermodynamics (the universe tends towards increasing disorderOur 
    - Software engineers' (approximate) abstractions necessarily become invalid with passing time and we need to start afresh.

  - software engineering: a a discipline for **solving business problems** by designing and developing software-based systems.
  - "*Software development still largely depends on heroic effort of select few developers. Product line and development standardization are still largely missing, but there are efforts in this direction.*"
    - product development & project management 
 
1.2 
  - *static* domain model
  - unit testing and integration testing
  - Waterfall model (linear and monolithic project life cycle)
  - Prototype vs. working instance
    - "*Incremental and iterative process seeks to get to a working instance as soon as possible (Marsic, 2012).*"
  -  incremental and iterative (or, evolutionary) development methods
    -  Unified process
    -  Agile
<br>
  
  - Modular design
  - Symbol language 
  - Project and product metrics
  - Design heuristics

<br>

  - use case modeling: a popular modelling technique

#### Software engineering starts from *problem definition* and applies the tools of the trade to find a *problem solution*. 
  - Requires methodology 
  - Manages software development process

#### A software engineer must:
  - understand the customer‚Äôs business needs and design software
  - quickly learn new disciplines and business processes

#### Software engineering vs. Programming
  - Software engineering (designing): understanding the business problem, coming up with an idea for solution, and designing the ‚Äúblueprints‚Äù of the solution.
  - Programming (writer): painting the picture on the blueprint. Writing the story in code. Giving a shape to the idea.

#### (Security) risks
After all, dividing the problem into smaller sub-units and conquering them piecewise could run the risk of harboring unforeseen problems that may arise when put together. 
Security risk is also another potential problem that may arise from logical cracks of the fabric.

Risks typically include conditions such as, the program can do what is expected of it and then some more, unexpected capabilities ("*does not guarantee logical rigor and strict consistency between the pieces.*")

## <span id="chapter12">1.2 Software Engineering Lifecycle</span> 

#### Software development processes

  - Planning / Specification
  - Design
  - Implementation
  - Evaluation 

#### Software development (Marsic, 2012)

  1. Requirements Specification
    - Understanding the usage scenarios and deriving the static domain model
  2. Design
    - Assigning responsibilities to objects and specifying detailed dynamics of their interactions under different usage scenarios
  3. Implementation
    - Encoding the design in a programming language
  4. Testing
    - Individual classes/components (unit testing) and the entire system (integration testing)
  5. Operation and Maintenance
   - Running the system; Fixing bugs and adding new features 

####  incremental and iterative (or, evolutionary) development methods

  1. Break the big problem down into smaller pieces (increments) and *prioritize* them.
  2. In each iteration *progress through* the development in more depth.
  3. Seek the customer *feedback* and change course based on improved understanding.

<br>

"*the key of incremental and iterative methods is to progressively deepen the understanding or ‚Äúvisualization‚Äù of the target product, by
both advancing and retracting to earlier activities to rediscover more of its features.*"

<br>

  - All lifecycle processes have a goal of incremental refinement of the product design
  - Unified Process
  - Agile (short iterations and heavy customer involvement)

<br>

1.2.2 Requirements Analysis and System Specification

1) use case modeling: a popular modelling technique

<br>

#### 1.2.3 Object-Oriented Analysis and the Domain Model 
#### 1.2.4 Object-Oriented Design 

*What makes the latter design realistic and what is lacking in the former design? Some observations:
  - The Rube Goldberg design uses complex components (the rabbit, the hound, etc.) with many unpredictable or uncontrollable behaviors; 
  - conversely, a realistic design uses specialized components with precisely controllable functions.

<br>

Recurring issues of software design

  - Design quality evaluation: feasibility of the real-world application
  - Design for 
    - change
    - reuse
    - security
    - testability

<br>

#### 1.2.5 Project Effort Estimation and Product Quality Measurement
  - "*there is a point beyond which only minor improvement in estimation accuracy is brought at a huge cost (known as the law of diminishing returns).*"

## <span id="chapter14">1.4 The Object Model </span>

[[üëÜtop]](#top) 

  - An **object** is a software packaging of data and code together into a unit within a running computer program.

  - A **method** is a function (also known as operation, procedure, or subroutine) associated with an object so that other objects can call on its services.

  - An **interface** specifies object‚Äôs
behavior‚Äîwhat kind of calls it accepts and what it does in response to each call.
    - The *services presented to a client object* comprise the **interface**. The interface is the fundamental *means of communication between objects*. Any behavior that an object provides *must be invoked by a message* sent using one of the provided interface methods.

  - An **attribute** is an item of data named by an identifier that represents some information about the object

  -  A **class** is a collection of objects that share the same set of attributes
and methods.
  
  - When an **instance** object is created, we say that the objects are **instantiated**.
  
  - A **constructors** is a smpecial method which is called at the creation of an
object to ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù the values of object‚Äôs data members (attributes).

<br>

#### Reductionism, modularity, and structuralism

  - The concept of objects allows us to divide software into smaller pieces to make it manageable. 
  - The ‚Äúobject orientation‚Äù is along the lines of the reductionism paradigm.

  - A design is **modular** when each activity of the system is performed by exactly one unit, and when inputs and outputs of each unit are well defined.

  - **Encapsulation**: is the process of packaging your program, dividing its classes into the public interface and the private implementation.

<br>

#### Object orientation
  - Controlling access to object elements, known as encapsulation
  - Object responsibilities and relationships
  - Reuse and extension by inheritance and composition 

"*Many programming languages allow making the internal state directly accessible through a variable manipulation, which is a bad practice. Instead, the access to object‚Äôs data should be controlled. The external state should be exposed through method calls, *"

<br>

### Access in java

  - Access to object attributes and methods is controlled using **access designations**, also known as visibility of attributes and methods.
  - `public`: other objects can directly access the method or object attributes. 
  - `private`: When an attribute or method is defined as `private`, only
that specific object can access it
  - `protected`: this modifier allows access by related objects
 
**UML notations**
  - ‚ûï for public, global visibility; 
  - #Ô∏è‚É£ for protected visibility; 
  - ‚ûñ for private within-the class-only visibility

  - Is-a relationship (hollow triangle symbol ‚àÜ in UML diagrams): A class ‚Äúinherits‚Äù from another class (a.k.a. base class, parent class, or superclass)
  - Has-a relationship: A class ‚Äúcontains‚Äù another class 
  - Composition relationship (filled diamond symbol ‚ô¶ in UML diagrams): The
contained item is an integral part of the containing item, such as a leg in a desk
  - Aggregation relationship (hollow diamond symbol ‚óä): The contained item is an element of a collection but it can also exist on its own, such as a desk in an office
  - Uses-a relationship (arrow symbol ‚Üì in UML diagrams): A class ‚Äúuses‚Äù another class
  - Creates relationship: A class ‚Äúcreates‚Äù another class (calls a constructor method) 

<br>

### Object's responsibilities

   The process of determining what the object should know (state) and what it should do (behavior) is known as assigning the responsibilities. What are object‚Äôs responsibilities? The key object responsibilities are:
   
  1. Knowing something (memorization of data or object attributes)
  2. Doing something on its own (computation programmed in a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù)
  3. Calling methods of other objects (communication by sending messages)

  - **Concept maps** are expressed in terms of concepts and propositions, and are used to represent knowledge, beliefs, feelings, etc.

  - **Encapsulation**
    - Object oriented approach goes a step further by emphasizing state **encapsulation**, which means hiding the object state, so that it can be observed or modified
only via object‚Äôs methods. This approach enables better control over interactions among the modules of an application.
