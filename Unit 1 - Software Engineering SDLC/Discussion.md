    A passenger aircraft is composed of several millions of parts and requires thousands of persons to assemble. 
    A four-lane highway bridge is another example of complexity. The first version of Word for Windows, 
    a word processor released by Microsoft in 1989, required 55 person-years, resulted into 249,000 lines of source code, 
    and was delivered 4 years late. Aircraft and highway bridges are usually delivered on time and within budget, 
    whereas software is often not. Discuss what are, in your opinion, 
    the differences between developing an aircraft, a bridge, and a word processor that would cause this situation.

  I tried to approach this question in terms of the characteristics the three project exhibit. First of all, what these three have in common is that they are system design and architecture problems. Designing a system is a complex and challenging mission because it requires the engineer to predict and calculate potential risks and problems that may arise when the product is physically manufactured. It is extremely hard to foresee the unknowns solely by conceptualising. Considering this, all three problems are supposed to be equally hard. However, as described in the problem, it's the software engineering that incurred the greatest man-hours and costs, while being seemingly the most comfortable job (because software engineers get to sit and type words most of the times, no hard work required like drilling, hammering, cutting and moving steels). Why is that? I think this question invites us to consider the following aspects:

(I would like to mention that I am no expert in these fields. I might be wrong. Please comment and share your knowledge with me if you disagree!)

Intangibility coupled with flexibility 

  In my opinion, the greatest difference between word processor development versus aircraft and bridge building is the intangibility. Software, in fact, is an extremely abstract artifact until the point it comes out as a finished product. During the stages of design and implementation, much part of the work will be done on the conceptual foundation. Although the designing of aircraft and bridge would be equally complex during the design stage, the building of the product becomes increasingly more visible over the course of putting all parts together. 
  
  Another characteristics of software development is the incredible flexibility of its nuts and bolts - variables and attributes, methods - that make up the software. Unlike hardware building (be it a vehicle or structure), the functionality of software parts (attributes and methods) are extremely flexible. Whereas hardware parts are designed to serve only a specified number of specific purpose, software parts are capable of serving various functions that are beyond the scope of the design intention. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to foresee every single possibility that the individual software parts can have. This problem of predicting the unknown capabilities become increasingly more challenging as the individual parts are put together to function as a system. One part intented to serve purpose A might actually be able to serve purposes B and C and D to Z once combined with other parts.

Finally, (in my imagination), the word processor has as many parts as a bridge may require if they were actual physical parts. Although it is not as immense in scale as aircraft and bridge (word processor is usually as big as your monitor), its complexity as a system is as complicated as the other physical two.

I thought about other aspects such as: 
  - Specification command
  - Client-orientation
  - Customisation and customisability
I conclude that these aren't applicable to the specific case of word processor as much, but they do in software engineering in general. What are your thoughts about this? Excited to read about your discussion!
